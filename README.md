An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The people who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. The company markets it's courses on several websites. Once the people check the website either they browse or fill the forms or watch video to know more about the courses.
The problem here is, there are many people/leads who visit the website but only few opts for the courses or pay for it. Here, we need to find out promising leads as paying customers.We need to build a model where we can assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher chance conversion and the customers with lower lead score have a lower chances conversion.
To find out high lead scoring customer we need to go through the activities of leads. How much time do they spend on website? What is their current position? What is their motto for joining the course? etc.
